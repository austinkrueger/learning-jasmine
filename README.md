# LearningJasmine

Hello, internet user!

This application was build soley to assist me in furthering my knowledge of Test Driven Development techniques.

It started through a tutorial I found on scotch.io, and I built it out a bit further than the features described there for extra practice.

The styling is a bit weird but that wasn't really the purpose of this practice, was more focused on getting the process of testing first down.
